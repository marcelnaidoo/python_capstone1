Finance calculator


The user is allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. How the user capitalises their selection does not affect how the program proceeds. I.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’, ‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc. these are all recognised as valid entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid input, an appropriate error message is displayed.

If the user selects ‘investment’: ■ Ask the user to input: ● The amount of money that they are depositing. ● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — The user should enter the number not the % (eg. 8 and not 8%). ● The number of years they plan on investing for. ● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called interest.

If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following: ■ Ask the user to input: ● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000 ● The interest rate. E.g. 7 ● The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. E.g. 120
